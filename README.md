## Question-One

Build a system to keep track of personal connections and their contact details. The system should allow users to add new contacts, modify existing ones, remove contacts, and retrieve a contact's details without specifying how to store the contacts.

## Question-Two

Design a system for a hotel to manage room booking, checking, and payment. Consider how to handle overlapping reservations and ensure data consistency

## Question-Three

Create a dynamic routing system for a city's public transport network that optimizes the bus and train schedules. The system should adjust for peak and off-peak traffic hours, special events that might increase passenger load, and routine maintenance of transport vehicles. Your programme aims to reduce overall travel time for passengers, enhance the frequency of service during high-demand periods, and ensure maintenance schedules are adhered to without significantly disrupting service.
