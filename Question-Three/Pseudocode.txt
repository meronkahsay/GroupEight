Input:
Transport routes with stops and connections
Schedules for buses and trains
Peak and off-peak hours data
Special event dates and expected passenger increases
Maintenance time slots for vehicles
Passenger demand patterns

process
1. Adjust service frequency based on current passenger volume: increase during busy hours, decrease during quiet hours.
2. During special events, increase trips and modify routes to handle extra passengers.
3. Schedule vehicle maintenance during periods of lower demand to reduce disruption.
4. Calculate fastest routes using updated service timings and connections.
5. Balance the number of vehicles running to meet passenger needs while allowing maintenance.

output:
Updated schedules optimized for travel time
Increased service frequency during high demand
Maintenance plans that minimize delays
Suggested routes for passengers with reduced waiting and travel times
